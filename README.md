# Music
I worked on this side project all of my freshman year of college and a bit in the summer after.
I wanted this to be a good representation of what I had learned throughout my first year of college.
You can view/download the src files or download the Music Demo folder.

#Music Demo folder
This demo provides a JavaFX implementation of Instrument.java
When opening the Music.jar file please make sure not to move it from the Music Demo folder!
My demo demonstrates the following
  - A graphic of a piano
    - Click the keys on the screen to play notes
    - Use your computer's keyboard to play chords. 
      Holding down the SHIFT key will toggle between a major or minor chord.
      (examples: A -> A Major, A + Shift -> A minor
  - Click the open button to upload a song *.csv file. An example is provided in the same Music Demo folder.
    - Note that the graphic changes based on the number of instruments in the csv
    - Click the start button to watch and listen to the song
    
#What I Learned
Here is a list of what skills I learned or improved throughout this project
  - Read data from a *.csv file
  - Interpret and parse data
  - Take advantage of different data structures
  - Basics to multi-threading
  - Design well structured data-types
  - Separate the logic from the graphics
  - Unit test
  - Importance of commenting and readability (although some of the more complex files still need work)
  
#What's next?
I want to focus on creating a different project. However, I do hope to eventually make the following improvements
  - User experience:
   - Modify Interpreter.java to be easier for the user. I recognize that it is currently too difficult to write a song *.csv file
   - Modify Interpreter.java to accept instrument files from a path. This seems very easy to do and I'm excited to see it.
   - Modify GUIDemo.java and the instrument.pane package
   
  - Clean up the code. This includes making it more readable and executing on the //NOTE: commentes I left myself.
  - Possibly add more implementations of javafx.scene.layout.Pane
