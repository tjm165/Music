# Music
This virtual keyboard side functions as a normal virtual keyboard but with unique features. Instead of limiting the user by their music theory knowledge, this app provides music theory shortcuts to help users play beyond the possible.

## What does it do?
The best way to learn what it can do is through my [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GprFtaiREaA)

## Music Demo folder
This demo provides a JavaFX implementation of Instrument.java
When opening the Music.jar file please make sure not to move it from the Music Demo folder!
My demo demonstrates the following
  - A graphic of a piano
    - Click the keys on the screen to play notes
    - Use your computer's keyboard to play chords. 
      Holding down the SHIFT key will toggle between a major or minor chord.
      (examples: A -> A Major, A + Shift -> A minor)
  - Click the open button to upload a song *.csv file. An example is provided in the same Music Demo folder.
    - Note that the graphic changes based on the number of instruments in the csv
    - Click the start button to watch and listen to the song
    
## What I Learned
Here is a list of what skills I learned or improved throughout this project
  - Parse and interpret commands
  - Parallel programming (Multi-threading and Java Runnables)
  - Playing music from a file is a lot like time based divisions in computer networks.
  - Take advantage of different data structures
  - Design well structured data-types
  - Separate the logic from the graphics
  - Unit testing
  - Importance of commenting and readability
  
## What's next?
While I want to continue to improve this application, I also want to explore creating other projects.
In the future, I hope to...
  - Implement AI to play music
  - Add more instruments and notes
  - Improve the graphics
  - Add sheet music like graphics in front of the csv
